Implementation of different models for Generative Adversarial Networks as decribed in:

* [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)
* [Wasserstein GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875)
* [Improved Training of Wasserstein GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00028)
* [The Cramer Distance as a Solution to Biased Wasserstein Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10743)

Also consensus optimization from: [The Numerics of GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10461)
